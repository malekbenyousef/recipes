<h1>Recipes:Ragu or meat sauce - the beef ragu takes around 10-15 minutes to prep (cutting the veg, browning the meat etc) but once you've done that you leave it to simmer away for a few hours while you get on with your day, easy!
Pasta - if you're making homemade pasta then the prep time is increased significantly which is fine if you're having a fun day of cooking but if you want as less prep as possible then use pre-bought fresh lasagna sheets/noodles. You can use dried but I recommend using fresh, see my notes below on why.
Bechamel sauce - this lasagna is a traditional Italian version so it's made with bechamel sauce and NOT ricotta cheese. You'll see ricotta used in Italian-American recipes. Don't worry though making a bechamel sauce from scratch takes no more than 10 mins and it can be prepped in advance or just before you are ready to assemble the dish.
Assembling the dish - this is the fun part and takes around 10 minutes (if that). Just layer up the pasta, ragu, bechamel and top with cheese, simple!
Cooking the lasagne - it takes around 45 minutes to bake in the oven so you can see why from start to finish it takes a pretty long time but all that time is not spent in the kitchen. Once you've made this from scratch using all our tips you won't believe how simple it is!</h1>
